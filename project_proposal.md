# Understanding Movies and TV Show Popularity (Show me the movies!)


## Project Topic

Creating a Machine Learning model to figure out how popular a movie would be based on relationship between genre, actor, director and other parameters.


## Rationale 

This could lead to helping define what combinations of parameters make a successful movie. Would having a particular director or actor (or a combination of parameters) involved in a movie guarantee its success?


## Data Sets

[Rotten Tomatoes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critics-datasets)
[Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)
[Movie Revenues](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)


## Project Stack

Linear regression model, Pandas, Tableau


## Project Goals

Machine learning Goal - How accurate of a model can we create that reflects a Rotten Tomatoes score based on the genre, actor, director, what should be the review rating/popularity be?
We will build a model with of the datasets with Rotten Tomatoes scoring and apply it to another model for Neflix review scoring 0-100 to review how well it can predict based on linear Regression. Once we have a functional model on one of our datasets, we will use it to the other two.
Our other goals include showing a relationship between directors, actors, genre and popularity/ratings. We will use Tableau once we have cleaned the data in Pandas and exported it to a master CSV.
